# jeux.adaptatech

This repository contains a collection of browser-based games for adaptive switches and assistive devices. The `switch` directory houses multiple music video games that react to key presses or switch inputs.

## Custom video support

Two dedicated pages allow you to create your own playlists:

- `switch/custom-videos-local/index.html` – upload video files from your computer.
- `switch/custom-youtube/index.html` – add clips via YouTube URLs.

Both pages use the same control panel as the regular games and support drag‑and‑drop reordering, removal of clips and all existing visual/sound options. The selected videos are played just like the built‑in playlists.

Preconfigured games continue to work without any changes. You can run the repository locally or host it on a server; the custom pages will load local files or remote URLs without affecting the other games.
